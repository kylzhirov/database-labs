# database-labs

As part of the database course, I - a student at AUCA university, am fully
commited in complete all the planned work and laboratory
assignments. The progress of each lab works is documented in .txt files.
For more detail explanation, certain part of the labs, particularly
involving table creation, advanced querying and etc. are stored
in .sql files.
